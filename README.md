# Leaf-Classification

This repository holds neural networks trained on a leaf species dataset available in the link below:

https://www.kaggle.com/c/leaf-classification

Given a probabilistic framework of shape, margin, and texture features as well as binary images of the samples, the goal is to predict the leaf specie using multiclass logarithmic loss as the evaluation metric.
There are a total of 99 speices in the dataset with ten samples for each as part of the train data. A very small sample to be using neural networks on but has still proven to be a good classifier. The main library used is
keras with Theano running in the backend.
